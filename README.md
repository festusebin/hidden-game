## Game Rules

At the start of a game one player is randomly assigned the traitor role while the other players get the agent role. Each player gets to choose one of three actions each turn:

- Spy: look at another player's role.
- Swap: swap the roles of two players.
- Confirm: look at your own role (it might have changed).

At the end of turn 3 a voting starts where players vote on who they think the traitor is. If the traitor is the most voted player then the agents win, otherwise the traitor wins.
